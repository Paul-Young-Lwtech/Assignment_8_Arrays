        Program 2: Array Analysis Function

        This program takes an array of numbers, than sends to a function
        that takes the array of numbers and a number as a parameter.

        The function counts and returns a number of times a given number has been
        repeated in the array.

        within the array and counts the amount of times the number is repeated.
        Than it returns the total of how many times the number is repeated.
